# Overview

 ---

This is a 2D Ray Tracer I implemented as my third project at BUAS in my first year. The renderer operates entirely on the CPU, making use of an Open GL template to display the image. I then build a simple car game to showcase the capabilites of the renderer

# Goals

 ---

- This was my first contact with ray tracing, helping me grasp the fundamental concepts of it

- Improving C++ skills and gaining experience with CPU-based algorithm optimization techniques

# Features

 ---

- Hard/Soft shadows support

- Support for mirror surfaces

- Ray intersection for lines and circles 

- Optimizated for supporting a large number of primitives/ lights

- Point/ Spot lights

- A really cool car game that makes use of those features
