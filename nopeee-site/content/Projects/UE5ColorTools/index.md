## Overview

This project started as a request from an artist to try implementing a vectorscope as a plugin for UE. It eventually evolved to also include a histogram and a waveform, tools which can be found in lots of production tools. 

All those tools could prove useful in the production pipeline, helping artists get objective insights into the colorization of a scene, without having to exit UE.
