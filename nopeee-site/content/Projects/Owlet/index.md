# Overview

| Role | Duration  | Platform | Team size | Graphics API |  
|:-------------|:-------------:|--------------:|:--------------:|--------------:|--------------:|
| Graphics Programmer  |16 weeks  | Windows + Steam Deck   |8 Programmers, 3 Designers, 3 Artists | DX12/DXR| 


Owlet is an RTS game developed using the PEPI custom engine. I worked as a graphics programmer in the team, building the foundation of the PEPI renderer(first 8 weeks) and then collaborationg with one more graphics programmer to build the tools demanded by our artists for the game and optimizing the performance of the renderer(for 8 more weeks). The PEPI renderer was built on top of my [Hybrid RayTracing renderer]({{< ref "/projects/hybridraytracer" >}}), making use of some of its features.

# Goals

- Experiencing working in a larger team of programmers
- Developing tools requested by other disciplines in the team
- Contributing to building a fully working game engine, later to be used in making a game
