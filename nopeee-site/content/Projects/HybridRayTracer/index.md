# Overview

---

This was my second project in my second year at BUAS, a deferred hybrid ray tracer I have built on top of a basic PBR DX12 renderer(which was my first project of Y2), using DXR.

# Goals

---

- Further exploring ray tracing concepts and learning how to use DXR 

- Getting to understand and implement a deferred renderer

- Getting to write an article on about it

- Exploring a modern rendering technique
