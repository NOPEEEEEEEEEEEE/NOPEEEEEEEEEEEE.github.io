## Umbra Mortis

Throughout this project I learned a bunch of new things, such as developing multiplayer games adn using networking concepts, using the Scene View Extension to add custom shader passes, or using Niagara. 

### Visual Effects

Since out team lacked a VFX artist, I took upon this role, applying my graphics experience to using Niagara.

#### Canals Water

The water is reactive to the environment, creating waves around objects that have contact with it.

### Gameplay

#### Lobby Practice Targets

#### Headshot Hitmarkers

Working on this lead to discovery that the shooting was not reliable and accurate for all the players in a session, which we eventually fixed.

### Networking

The networking aspect of the game did make the development a little bit more difficult. Even for the visual elements of the game, some required replication of different parameters.



### Research 

In the early stages of the project, when the vision was not yet clear, I decided to experiment with the Scene View Extension class in Unreal Engine 5. This allows injecting custom shader passes at different stages of the rendering pipeline.
